# Physics Experiments

## Introduction: 
Hi there! In this repository I present a series of experiments that I did while I was studying physics. 

In this repository you may find experiments from optics, electromagnetism, electronic and so on. The index corresponds to:


## Index 


1. Faraday Effect: This experiments demonstrates a proportionality between the polarization plane of light and the intensity of a magntic field. We found a collection of value for the Verdettt's constant. 

2. Ionization potential: In this experiment we found the potencial value for the ionization of gas inside of a vaccum tube 2D21. Our results are modeled by the Langsmuir-Child expression. 

3. High Entropy Alleys: In this experiment we develop a theoric and experiment job related to the combination of multiple elements in the creation of thin layers.
